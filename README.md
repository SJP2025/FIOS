This is a project I kind of thought up as practice project. The point is keep developting my skill as a Powershell developer.
-The Goals I'm working on here are... 
1st- A portable modular frame work. The point here here is a drop and run functionality. (Rapping code/modules in functions, each in a single ".ps1" file that will load into memory with the framework so long as the modular ".pd1" files/functions are drop into a folder that is coded dymanically dot-soource ita contact into scope.
2nd- A dymanically generatated set absolute path variables is implemented to add/embed the abilty to add and easily map custom functionality into the frame work itself.
3rd- A interactive API functionality is implented via functions call from within PS Terminal by simply loading isolated compoments of the framework into memory from the PS Console.
